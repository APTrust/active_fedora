h2. Installation

The gem is hosted on gemcutter.

<pre>gem install active-fedora</pre>

h2. Getting Started

The "ActiveFedora Console Tour":https://github.com/mediashelf/active_fedora/blob/master/CONSOLE_GETTING_STARTED.textile  gives you a brief tour through ActiveFedora's features on the command line.

h2. Testing

In order to run the RSpec tests, you need to have a copy of the ActiveFedora source code, and then run bundle install in the source directory.

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/mediashelf/active_fedora.git
cd /wherever/active_fedora/is
bundle install
</pre>

You also need to have a copy of hydra-jetty running.  To do this, download a working copy of "hydra-jetty":https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-jetty, cd into its root and run 

<pre>
java -jar start.jar
</pre>

Then open a new terminal, go to your ActiveFedora source directory, and import fedora's demo objects.

<pre>
cd /wherever/active_fedora/is
export FEDORA_HOME=/path/to/hydra/jetty/fedora/default
$FEDORA_HOME/client/bin/fedora-ingest-demos.sh localhost 8983 fedoraAdmin fedoraAdmin http
</pre>
  
You must ingest one fixture using the import_fixture rake task provided by the hydra project.

<pre>
rake fedora:import_fixture pid=hydrangea_fixture_mods_article1
</pre>

Now you're ready to run 

<pre>
cd /wherever/active_fedora/is
rake spec
</pre>

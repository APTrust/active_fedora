h2. Getting Started

The "ActiveFedora Console Tour":http://projects.mediashelf.us/wiki/active-fedora/Getting_Started gives you a brief tour through ActiveFedora's features on the command line.

h2. Testing

In order to run the RSpec tests, you need to have a copy of hydra-jetty running.  To do this, download a working copy of hydra-jetty, cd into its root and run 
<pre>java -jar start.jar</pre>

Then open a new terminal and import fedora's demo objects.

<pre>
export FEDORA_HOME=/path/to/hydra/jetty/fedora/default
$FEDORA_HOME/client/bin/fedora-ingest-demos.sh localhost 8983 fedoraAdmin fedoraAdmin http
<pre>
  
You must ingest one fixture using the import_fixture rake task provided by the hydra project:
<pre>
  rake hydra:import_fixture pid=hydrangea:fixture_mods_article1
</pre>

Now you're ready to run 

<pre>
cd /wherever/active_fedora/is
rake spec
</pre>
